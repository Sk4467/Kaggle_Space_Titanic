# Kaggle_Space_Titanic
Classification problem from kaggle. 


The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.

Task is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly.

                                                      ##ATTRIBUTE INFORMATION##
PassengerId - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.
HomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.
CryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.
Cabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.
Destination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.
Age - The age of the passenger.
VIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.
RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.
Name - The first and last names of the passenger.
Transported - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.
